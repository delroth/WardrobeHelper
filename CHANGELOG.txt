== BUGS ==
 * Baradin Hold is bugged, VoA is bugged
 * Many staves are missing
    https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/monars-wardrobehelper/tickets/18-addon-does-not-detect-missing-two-hand-staves/
 * fix HC/Mythic/.. items - not even refresh instance works because of that
 * invasions are bugged (show loot you can't unlock and can't be refreshed)

 * This raid is missing   Dump: value=GetInstanceInfo() [1]="Gruul's Lair", [2]="raid", [3]=4, [4]="25 Player", [5]=25, [6]=0, [7]=false, [8]=565, [9]=25 Also do not see this one, but im not sure if they get totally removed from the list if you have all items? Its a little raid instance so might have all items, so if they get removed then you should be told i think when entering the,   [1]="Magtheridon's Lair", [2]="raid", [3]=4, [4]="25 Player", [5]=25, [6]=0, [7]=false, [8]=544, [9]=25

 * 4 raids are not marked as under currently saved in french. I think the problem is the translation is not exactly the good one : "Caverne du sanctuaire du Serpent" ->  "Glissecroc : caverne du sanctuaire du Serpent" "Le Temple noir" ->  "Temple noir" "L'Œil" -> "Donjon de la Tempête" "Plateau du Puits de soleil" -> "Le Puits de soleil"
